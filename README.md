# RythmGameVideoEditor

This is a personal project and a work in progress.
 
Uses SDL2 version 2.26.3
and a ffmpeg build for x64-windows

Not tested on other machines, so no guarantees it will build/run correctly
I did not put any work into making the building process user friendly for anyone except myself.
